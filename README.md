Comments about the website can be found on all the pages, but the script.js page and the index.html page have the most comments.

The goal of this website was to create a game, wherein the user could answer basic questions about coding. There are five questions. There is a serious answer for all of them, though many of the answers are silly and meant to give a laugh.

To start the game, you press the 'Start Game' button. This launches the timer. The user has 60 seconds to play the game. The goal is to complete all of the questions correctly in the shortest amount of time. Ideally, the timer would delete two seconds for every wrong answer.

As you press the buttons to answer the questions, you are told whether you are correct or wrong. You press the 'Next Question' button to move to the next question and answer series. When you reach the fifth question, a button appears that says 'Push to Score'. This stops the timer and gives you information in the form of an alert. If you don't finish before the timer runs out at zero, then you are given a different alert.

There is an input box where you can enter your initials and your score.

A work in progress:
The programmer has run out of time to finish this website with all of the functionality intended. The programmer ran into propagation issues that reduced intended functionality. These could not be fixed with the remaining time. 

The programmer could not reduce the seconds when the user would get a wrong answer, because of a propagation/bubbling issue that exponentiated the number of seconds subtracted. The programmer also could not get local storage to function as intended, though there is a kind of session storage that works through the input box.

The programmer intends to work on this page going forward.
